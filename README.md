# Haskell De Facto

A curated list of de facto packages of the Haskell world :package:

## Preface

I'd like to make it clear that this list is subjective. I also understand that some people don't like the word 'De Facto',
as it sounds like limitation on the variety of viable packages. I, though, prefer sticking to very practical and well-made
packages, contributing on them, and making them better.

Therefore, please consider this list as my personal references of choosing the best packages to do my job.

## List

- Command-line option parser: [optparse-applicative](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative)
- YAML parser: [yaml](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml)
- HTTP client: [wreq](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq)
- Time: [time](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time)
- URL Routing: If it's simple enough, just use [`pathInfo`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-3.2.1.1/docs/Network-Wai.html#v:pathInfo). If needing more power, consider [web-routes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/web-routes).
- to be added...
